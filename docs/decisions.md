# Descisions

Implementing an OAuth 2.0 solution involves breaking down the functionality into several microservices to handle different aspects of the process, such as user registration, authentication, and authorization. Here are the microservices that you might implement:

## User Service

### Responsibilities:

* Manage user registration, profile management, and user data.
* Store user information securely, including password hashes.

### Endpoints:

* **POST /register**: Register a new user.
* **GET /users/{id}**: Get user details.
* **PUT /users/{id}**: Update user details.
* **DELETE /users/{id}**: Delete a user.

### Technologies:

* **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.
* **Hashing**: bcrypt for secure password hashing.

## Authentication Service

### Responsibilities:

* Handle user login, issue tokens (access tokens, refresh tokens), and validate credentials.

### Endpoints:

* **POST /login**: Authenticate a user and issue tokens.
* **POST /logout**: Invalidate tokens.
* **POST /token/refresh**: Refresh access tokens using refresh tokens.

### Technologies:

* JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for token generation and validation.
* OAuth 2.0 protocols for handling token issuance and validation.

## Authorization Service

### Responsibilities:

* Manage user permissions and roles, and enforce access controls.
* Provide authorization decisions based on roles and permissions.

### Endpoints:

* **GET /authorize**: Authorize a request based on tokens. 
* **POST /roles**: Create new roles. 
* **POST /permissions**: Create new permissions. 
* **POST /assign-role**: Assign roles to users. 
* **POST /assign-permission**: Assign permissions to roles.

### Technologies:

* RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) or ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) systems. 
* Integration with Authentication Service for token validation.

## Token Service

### Responsibilities:

* Manage token lifecycle, including issuing, refreshing, and revoking tokens.

### Endpoints:

* **POST /token**: Issue tokens.
* **POST /token/validate**: Validate tokens.
* **POST /token/revoke**: Revoke tokens.

### Technologies:
   •	JWT or OAuth 2.0 compliant tokens.
   •	Secure storage for token blacklisting and revocation (e.g., Redis).

## Client Management Service

### Responsibilities:

* Manage OAuth 2.0 clients (applications that will use the OAuth 2.0 service).

### Endpoints:

* POST /clients: Register new clients.
* GET /clients/{id}: Get client details.
* PUT /clients/{id}: Update client details.
* DELETE /clients/{id}: Delete a client.

### Technologies:

* Database for storing client information.

## Resource Service

### Responsibilities:

* Protect resources that require authorization and enforce access control.

### Endpoints:

* Various endpoints depending on the resources being protected (e.g., /resource/{id}).

### Technologies:

* Integration with Authorization Service to enforce access control.

## API Gateway

### Responsibilities:

* Act as a single entry point for all client requests.
* Route requests to appropriate services and handle authentication and authorization.

### Technologies:

* API Gateway solutions like Kong, NGINX, or AWS API Gateway.

## Architectural Flow

1.	User Registration:
   * Client sends registration request to User Service. 
   * User Service stores user data and returns a success response.

2.	User Login:
   * Client sends login request to Authentication Service.
   * Authentication Service validates credentials, issues tokens, and returns them to the client.

3.	Authorization:
   * Client includes access token in requests to protected resources.
   * Resource Service forwards the token to Authorization Service for validation.
   * Authorization Service validates the token and checks permissions, then returns the authorization decision.

4.	Token Management:
   * Token Service handles issuing, refreshing, and revoking tokens as needed.

## Technologies

* **Languages**: Go
* **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
* **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for tokens
* **Protocols**: OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (if needed for identity management)

This setup allows for scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns, ensuring that each service can 
be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
